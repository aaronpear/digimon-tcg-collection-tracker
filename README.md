<h1>Digimon TCG Collection Tracker</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This app takes data from this public Digimon TCG API https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14059948/TzecB4fH and displays it in
numerous ways, mainly for the purposes of retaining records for your own personal collection.<br /><br />
You can access the current live version on the web here: <br />

<h2>What can it do?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep track of quantities owned of any specific card (note: the Digimon TCG API used does not contain data for alternate art cards)</li>
  <li>Save cards to a Custom list for ease of tracking</li>
  <li>Search by: <b>Card Name</b> or <b>Set Number</b></li>
  <li>View Cards by: <b>All</b>, <b>Custom</b>, <b>Owned</b>, or <b>Unowned</b>
</ul>
<p>All data is set to local storage for future use.</p>
<p>The default state for viewing is set to 'Custom'.</p>
